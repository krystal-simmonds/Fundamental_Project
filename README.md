## **Brief**

The brief for this project is to create a CRUD application using the supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

### **Scope**

The following requirements also need to be implemented:

* A Jira Kanban Board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.

* The application must have a functioning front-end website and integrated API. 

* Fully designed test suites for the application, as well as automated tests for validation of the application.

* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System

### **Approach**

I have decided to create a simple forum engine application where users will be able to do the following:

*Create a user account that stores:

 *First name and Last name
 *USername
 *Email
 *Password
*Upload a photo of a pair of trainers they have seen to get more information on the pair and discussion. Posts will have the following information
 *Title
 *Author
 *Timestamp
 *Tag
 *Comment on post
 * View, update or delete their account
