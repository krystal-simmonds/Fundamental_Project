## **Brief**

The brief for this project is to create a CRUD application using the supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

### **Scope**

The following requirements also need to be implemented:

* A Jira Kanban Board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.

* The application must have a functioning front-end website and integrated API. 

* Fully designed test suites for the application, as well as automated tests for validation of the application.

* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System

### **Approach**

I have decided to create a simple blog application where users will be able to do the following:

* Create a user account that stores:

  * First name and Last name
  * Username
  * Email
  * Password
* Add entries that will include:
  * Shoe name
  * Shoe size
  * Brand
  * Colour
* Users will also be allowed to:
  * View, edit or delete entries
